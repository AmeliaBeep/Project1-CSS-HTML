                <p>
                    Everyone deserves to feel safe, respected, and protected. Our role
                    is to make safeguarding clear, accessible, and supportive for
                    everyone.

                <p>
                    On this site, you'll find straightforward information about what
                    safeguarding means, how to recognise the signs when something isn't
                    right, and what to do if you're worried about someone. Whether you
                    are a parent, carer, professional, or member of the community, you
                    have an important part to play in keeping people safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are here to guide you, provide resources, and connect you with
                    the right help when it's needed. Together, we can build safer
                    communities where children, young people, and adults at risk are
                    protected and able to thrive.

                    <h2>What is Safeguarding?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Safeguarding means protecting people's health, wellbeing, and
                        human rights. It is about keeping individuals safe from harm,
                        abuse, neglect, and exploitation — and creating safe environments
                        where everyone can live, learn, and thrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Safeguarding is especially important for children, young people,
                        and adults who may be more vulnerable due to age, disability,
                        illness, or life circumstances. But safeguarding is everyone's
                        responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <h3>In practice, safeguarding means:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognising the signs of abuse or neglect</li>
                        <li>Responding in the right way when concerns arise</li>
                        <li>Reporting worries to the right people or services</li>
                        <li>
                            Promoting environments where people feel safe, respected, and
                            supported
                        </li>

                    <h2>Signs to Watch For</h2>
                    <p>
                        Abuse and neglect are not always easy to see. Knowing the signs
                        can help you recognise when someone may need help and protection.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Possible signs in children and young people:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unexplained injuries or frequent accidents</li>
                        <li>
                            Sudden changes in behaviour, such as becoming withdrawn or
                            aggressive
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fear of going home or reluctance to be around certain people
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Poor hygiene, unsuitable clothing, or consistently being hungry
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Struggles at school, frequent absences, or loss of concentration
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Possible signs in adults at risk:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unexplained injuries or frequent hospital visits</li>
                        <li>Signs of fear, anxiety, or confusion</li>
                        <li>Poor living conditions or lack of basic care</li>
                        <li>Sudden withdrawal from friends, activities, or community</li>
                        <li>
                            Being controlled by others, for example, in finances or
                            decision-making
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A single sign on its own may not mean someone is being abused or
                        neglected. What matters most is noticing when there is a pattern
                        of signs or when your instinct tells you something isn't right.

                        If you are worried, it is always better to speak up and seek
                        advice.

                    <p>
                        Recognising a safeguarding concern can feel worrying — but taking the right steps quickly
                        can make a real difference. You do not need to have proof of harm. If something feels wrong,
                        it is important to act.

                            <p>
                                If someone discloses a concern to you, listen carefully. Reassure them that they did the
                                right
                                thing by speaking up. Avoid making promises you can't keep, such as keeping it secret.

                            <p>Make sure the person is safe in the moment. Do not confront the person you suspect may be
                                causing harm. Write down what you saw, heard, or were told — using the person's own
                                words
                                if possible.</p>

                                Contact your organisation's safeguarding lead if you have one. If you believe someone is
                                in
                                immediate danger, call 999 right away. For non-emergencies, contact your local
                                safeguarding board, social services, or the police on 101.
                            </p>

                                Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility, but you are not expected to handle it by
                                yourself.
                                By reporting your concerns, you are helping professionals step in to provide the right
                                protection and support.
