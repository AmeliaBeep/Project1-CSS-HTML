# Application Purpose and user value
A one page website to demonstrate an understanding of HTML and CSS principles.

Introduces users to safeguarding principles, how to spot the signs and how to act on concerns.

# Application contents overview

## The website renders responsively depending on screen size

![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen showing information cards](assets/images/readme/card-small-device.png "Small device size showing information cards")

Here the navbar has burger menu containing the site links and all website content is stacked vertically.

![Website as rendered on a device with a medium screen](assets/images/readme/medium-device.png "Medium device size has navbar ")
![Website as rendered on a device with a large screen](assets/images/readme/large-device.png "Large device size")

On screens sizes medium and above the navbar has expanded to show the contents now along the bar.

The Signs to Watch For cards are now side by side for large screen sizes and above.

![Website as rendered on a device with a XL screen](assets/images/readme/xl-device.png "XL device size")
![Website as rendered on a device with a XXL screen](assets/images/readme/xxl-device.png "XXL device device size")

XL and XXL screen sizes now have the header image side by side with the text instead of stacked.

## The navbar menu
![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen with the navbar closed](assets/images/readme/small-device.png "Small device size navbar closed")
![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen with the navbar open](assets/images/readme/small-device-open.png "Small device size with navbar open")
![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen with the navbar closed and having been sent to a section heading](assets/images/readme/card-small-device.png "Small device size with navbar closed after using one of the navigation links")

The navbar options take the user to the specific headings on the page without covering them.

# Deployment procedure
Github pages automatically redploys site updates upon pushes to the remote repository.

# AI usage
I mainly used AI to generate website name suggestions and produce the text to populate the website sections. Additionally I had it generate some of the HTML paragraph structure for the text it generated. It did somewhat help but added unneccesary tags I then had to remove.

I did not use to it fix or optimise any code for this project, because I did not feel the need to for this particular project.
