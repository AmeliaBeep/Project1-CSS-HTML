# Application Purpose


# User
Introduces users to safeguarding principles, how to spot the signs and how to act on concerns

# Deployment procedure
Github pages automatically redploys site updates upon pushes to the remte repository


# AI usage
I mainly used AI to generate website name suggestions and produce the text to populate the website sections. Additionally I had it generate some of the HTML paragraph structure for the text it generated. It did somewhat help but add unneccesary tags I then had to remove.

I did not use to it fix or optimise any code for this project, because I did not feel the need to for this particular project.
