# Application Purpose and user value
A one page website demonstrate an understanding of HTML and CSS principles.

Introduces users to safeguarding principles, how to spot the signs and how to act on concerns.

# Application contents overview

## The website renders responsively depending on screen size

![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen](assets/images/readme/small-device.png "Small device size")

Here the navbar has burger menu containing the site links and all website content is stacked vertically.

![Website as rendered on a device with a medium screen](assets/images/readme/medium-device.png "Medium device size has navbar ")
![Website as rendered on a device with a large screen](assets/images/readme/large-device.png "Large device size")

On screens sizes medium and above the navbar has expanded to show the contents now along the bar.

![Website as rendered on a device with a XXL screen](assets/images/readme/xxl-device.png "XXL device device size")

XL and XXL screen sizes now have the header image side by side with the text instead of stacked.

## The navbar menu

![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen with the navbar open](assets/images/readme/small-device-open.png "Small device size with navbar open")
![Website as rendered on a device with a small screen with the navbar closed and having been sent to a section heading](assets/images/readme/small-device-navbar-outcome.png "Small device size with navbar closed after using one of the navigation links")

The navbar options take the user to the specific headings on the page without covering them.

## Other user centric design elements

- Use of colour and weights to differentiate headings and subheadings
- A font choice that felt professional but welcoming
- For most screen sizes the navbar elements have padding to make them more central and alined with the page content.

# Deployment procedure
Github pages automatically redploys site updates upon pushes to the remte repository.

# AI usage
I mainly used AI to generate website name suggestions and produce the text to populate the website sections. Additionally I had it generate some of the HTML paragraph structure for the text it generated. It did somewhat help but added unneccesary tags I then had to remove.

I did not use to it fix or optimise any code for this project, because I did not feel the need to for this particular project.
